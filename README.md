# U-Net Model for Core Multi-Component Image Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of the U-Net model for segmenting core multi-component images. The model is built using PyTorch and is designed to perform semantic segmentation on images related to geological core data.

## Installation

Before running the model, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The following instructions will guide you through the setup process.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/....../this_repo.git
cd this_repo

Install Required Dependencies
You will need Python 3.6+ and the required libraries. It is recommended to create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
1. Training the Model
Once the dataset is ready, you can start training the model using the following command:

python train.py

This will begin the training process, where the model will learn to segment the core multi-component images. You can adjust training parameters in train.py (such as the learning rate, batch size, etc.) to fine-tune the training process.

Testing the Model
After training is complete, you can test the model with the following command:
python test.py


This will evaluate the model on the test dataset and output the segmentation results.

Configuration
You can modify the hyperparameters, paths, and other settings in the train.py and test.py files. For example, you can specify the dataset location, number of epochs, and the model save directory.

Model Architecture
The model utilizes the standard U-Net architecture, which is designed for semantic segmentation tasks. It consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. The network uses skip connections to preserve spatial information across layers.
